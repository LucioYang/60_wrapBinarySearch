## Inverse Functions and Logarithms
0. What is meant by y = logBASE(2,x)?
   - y = logBASE(2,x) means *y equals the number of 2s needed to be multiplied together to get x*
1. What does its graph look like?
   - The graph looks like a curve with x and y increasing concurrently, though the rate of increase decreases as x increases. The graph has an asymptote of x = 0 and a root at x = 1. 
## Recursive Solution
Decision to choose the base case or the recursive cases:
`Is low > hi?`
